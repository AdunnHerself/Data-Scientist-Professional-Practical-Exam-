Supervised machine learning project: Predict which recipes will lead to high traffic and Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time.

Tasty Bytes was founded in 2020 during the Covid Pandemic. The world was in need of inspiration, and Tasty Bytes decided to provide it. It started as a search engine for recipes, helping people find ways to use up the limited supplies they had at home. Now, over two years later, Tasty Bytes is a fully-fledged business that puts together a full meal plan for a monthly subscription to ensure that families get a healthy, balanced diet regardless of their budget.

The company has noticed that traffic to the website goes up by as much as 40% when a popular recipe is picked. However, it is difficult to predict which recipes will be popular. The company is looking for a way to predict high-traffic recipes with 80% accuracy.

The goal of this project is to:
* Predict which recipes will lead to high traffic
* Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time
